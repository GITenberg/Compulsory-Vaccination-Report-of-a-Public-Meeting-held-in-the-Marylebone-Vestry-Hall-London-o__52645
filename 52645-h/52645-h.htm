3</span>REPORT.</h2>
<p>On Wednesday Evening, October 19th, 1870, a Public Meeting,
convened at the requisition, numerously signed, of the ratepayers
of Marylebone, was held in the Vestry Hall of that large
Metropolitan Parish.&nbsp; The object of the Meeting, as
announced by advertisement, was &ldquo;to take into consideration
the Acts of Parliament which render Vaccination
Compulsory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chair was occupied by R. <span
class="smcap">Hallam</span>, Esq. a Vestryman, who said, it was
twelve months that day, since a meeting was held in that hall,
for the purpose of inaugurating a Marylebone Branch of the
Anti-Vaccination League.&nbsp; Some gentlemen of the medical
profession, subsequently said that if they had been present, they
could have upset all the arguments on the other side.&nbsp; The
executive of the Marylebone Branch had very straightforwardly
said, they would be happy to meet those professional gentlemen,
and the public notice which the secretary would read, invited
their presence.&nbsp; The notice having been read, the Chairman
proceeded to say it must be apparent to all that they were not
assembled there to make pecuniary profit.&nbsp; They did not come
to receive vaccination fees, but to enter their protest against
such an iniquity.&nbsp; The subject they were to discuss was one
of the most important that could engage their attention.&nbsp; A
great outcry had been raised about the unfortunate position they
stood in with respect to infanticide and baby-farming; and Dr.
Lankester, one of the coroners for Middlesex, had made himself
very busy to have a check put upon those practices, but why did
not the coroner reflect upon the enormous amount of infanticide
caused by the point of the lancet?&nbsp; Could he be a
conscientious <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>man, when he carried his prejudice for vaccination into
the coroner&rsquo;s court?&nbsp; He very much regretted that they
had a medical coroner, and although he had voted for him at
first, he would promise never to vote for another gentleman of
the same profession.&nbsp; He then referred to the recent inquiry
in St. Pancras, on the body of a child which died the day after
it was vaccinated.&nbsp; The death was attributed to congestion
of the lungs, but the iniquitous part of the proceedings was that
the doctor who vaccinated performed the post-mortem
examination.&nbsp; Referring to the general question, he said
that under the vaccination system, even when small-pox was absent
there was an equivalent disease present.&nbsp; Dr. Lankester
himself, in a return he had furnished to the parish of St.
James&rsquo;s, said that although they had no small-pox, they had
its equivalent&mdash;scarlet fever&mdash;very bad.&nbsp; Dr.
Lankester had also said that there were three small-pox cases in
the hospital; one patient was unvaccinated, and two had been
vaccinated.&nbsp; That order of things was not according to the
promise of the vaccinators, who told them that vaccination was a
preventative.&nbsp; Before calling on the speakers he would just
say to the medical profession, that they desired a fair and
impartial investigation.&nbsp; As an individual he was open to
conviction, if any gentleman present could prove he was in the
wrong, but as far as he at present saw, he should as much expect
to see the sun shining in the middle of the night, as to be
convinced of the utility of vaccination.&nbsp; If any medical
gentlemen wished to speak and would hand up their names they
should be heard.</p>
<p>Dr. Routh and Dr. Thompson (of the Brompton Hospital) sent up
then cards.</p>
<p>Mr. Snell, on rising, said that the meeting was, no doubt,
acquainted with the account of Do-the-boys Hall, in <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>one of the
works of the late Charles Dickens, in which an amusing
description is given of the weekly administration of brimstone
and treacle.&nbsp; The boy had to open his mouth and <i>nolens
volens</i>, receive therein and swallow the spoonful.&nbsp; Now,
said the speaker, we Englishmen are in a somewhat similar
position; it is true we are not commanded to open our
<i>mouths</i>, but our <i>veins</i>, to receive the poison of a
diseased brute.&nbsp; Now the celebrated John Hunter, the great
Anatomist and Physiologist said, &ldquo;Any extraneous substance
introduced into the blood modifies the vitalized or living
fluid.&nbsp; The introduction of animal products from another
living body, be it a man, a cow, or even the ass, is infinitely
more pernicious because allied to it, being
vitalized.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held, therefore, that government
violated a natural law, besides one of the fundamental principles
of the English constitution, when it enforced this odious
compulsory vaccination, by depriving parents of their
liberty&mdash;committing them to prison for refusing to
contaminate their infants with the disease of a brute.&nbsp; The
speaker then briefly called attention to the law of vicarious
mortality, which had been so ably elucidated by Dr. Pearce, in
his Essay on Vaccination, which proved that we had no control
over the epidemic visitations of small-pox, or any other
disease.&nbsp; With great pleasure, he moved the following
resolution.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That the enforcement of the practice of
so-called Vaccination, is an interference with the liberty of the
subject, and injurious to the community, and that therefore, this
meeting is of opinion that the Vaccination Acts ought to be
repealed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resolution was seconded by Dr. McOubrey, who called the
attention of the meeting to the unconstitutional character of the
Acts which enforced the practice of <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>vaccination; giving power to
magistrates to consign to prison, men and women, without trial by
jury.&nbsp; He adverted to the almost unexceptional practice of
magistrates, of cruelly inflicting the utmost penalty of the law,
and this in defiance of the clause in the Act, which provides
that if a reasonable excuse be offered, the fine may not be
inflicted.&nbsp; The loss of one or even two children by
vaccination, was not held by any magistrate to be a sufficient or
reasonable excuse.&nbsp; Moreover, said the speaker, there is no
justification for the law, the whole thing is a delusion.&nbsp;
Vaccination never did prevent small pox, and Jenner knew
it&mdash;and therefore he invented a theory that the virus from
the horses&rsquo; heel was the true source of the matter, and was
alone protective.&nbsp; The disease which Jenner produced was not
like small-pox.&nbsp; Phag&aelig;denic ulcers, with inflamed and
swollen glands in the axilla, were the result of the process
which he imposed upon the government, and on his unproved
assertion, that his process would protect the subject for ever,
obtained no less than thirty thousand pounds of British
gold.&nbsp; And this was done against the protest of all the
leading medical men of the time.</p>
<p>What are the facts regarding this professed protective
power?&nbsp; Why, that of the patients admitted into the
small-pox Hospital, no less than eighty-four of every hundred
eases, were found vaccinated! call you this protection?&nbsp; The
whole thing is a falsehood.</p>
<p>Take the fact that in Paris, in the Barracks of the 1st
regiment of the Voltigeurs of the Guard, in 1867, the soldiers
were vaccinated to the number of 457, when towards the end of
1868, a small-pox epidemic in a highly confluent form, broke out
in this regiment.&nbsp; This epidemic <i>made many victims</i>
where the hygienic conditions, as space, ventilation and food
were excellent; while in the <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>2nd regiment, in a similar barrack in
the same court-yard, but wherein <i>no vaccination</i> had been
done, <i>not a single case of small-pox occurred</i>.</p>
<p>Take another case.&nbsp; In Bavaria every person is
vaccinated, yet a short time ago small-pox broke out in Munich,
and the Royal Pages were seized with small-pox.&nbsp; The Royal
Court left the capital in alarm, not less than if a shell had
burst in their midst.&nbsp; Since the passing of the Compulsory
Act almost every constitutional disease that flesh was heir to
had increased most alarmingly.&nbsp; In 1866, 122,222 persons
died of chest disease, and of consumption alone 55,714.&nbsp; Now
consumption was increasing by 2,000 cases a year.&nbsp; These
facts should rouse the people to indignation against a government
whose acts are despotic and which aimed at the destruction of the
people&rsquo;s liberty.&nbsp; He cordially seconded the
resolution.</p>
<p>Before putting the resolution to the meeting the Chairman
intimated to Dr. Routh who had sent up his card that if he wished
to move an amendment he could now do so.</p>
<p>Dr. Routh said: It was not his intention to move a formal
amendment to the resolution, but merely a negative vote.&nbsp; He
was very much surprised at the two speeches he had heard.&nbsp;
He had no doubt, both the gentlemen were perfectly convinced they
were right, but he did not know how they could have come to that
conclusion if they had taken statistics.&nbsp; They had been told
that the mortality from every form of disease had increased, but
it had not done so from small-pox.&nbsp; The population was
increasing, and therefore there were more deaths than there used
to be.&nbsp; The speakers on the other side were taking a time
when the whole population of the kingdom was not more than
20,000,000, and comparing the gross number of deaths then with
those that took place now; they ought, if they <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>meant to deal
fairly, to take the number of deaths to the million of
population.&nbsp; It had been said that by the statistics of the
Small-pox Hospital a greater number of persons were there who had
been vaccinated than had not.&nbsp; What was the fact?&nbsp; The
official return showed the following:&mdash;Number of deaths
among the unvaccinated, 35 per cent.; vaccinated with one vaccine
cicatrice, 7; with two cicatrices, 4; with three, 1; with four,
5&ndash;10ths.&nbsp; Well-marked, 2; badly-marked, 18; those who
had previously had small-pox, 19.&nbsp; This last average showed
that the vaccine was a better preventative than small-pox
itself.&nbsp; Dr. Seaton, medical officer of the Privy Council,
had published a return showing the annual death-rate in England
and Wales.&nbsp; The death-rate per million of population during
the 30 years previous to vaccination was 3,000.&nbsp; In
&rsquo;38 and &rsquo;40, when vaccination was diffused, but
before it was gratuitous, it was 770.&nbsp; The average for nine
of the years when public vaccination was gratuitous but not
obligatory was 304, and during the time it was both gratuitous
and obligatory, the vaccination death-rate was 202 per
million.&nbsp; Who, in the face of that, would maintain that
vaccination was not a preventative of small-pox?&nbsp; Having
referred to the ravages the disease used to commit, and the
powerful nature of the small-pox virus, he proceeded to say that
a great deal had been made of the fact that more people died of
other diseases than usual, when deaths from small-pox were few in
number.&nbsp; It stood to reason that if they saved a certain
number of people from a certain disease, they must leave a
greater number than if they had not saved them to die afterwards
from some other disease.&nbsp; So, when a fearful epidemic had
just left a place the number of deaths for some time afterwards
was much smaller than at any other time during a long period of
health.&nbsp; The <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>reason of this was that nearly all the weak had been
killed.&nbsp; It had been said that vaccine put into the system a
great number of noxious diseases.&nbsp; That rested on the mere
<i>ipse dixit</i> of a few persons.&nbsp; No doubt, in the
crowded and unhealthy neighbourhoods of the poor, where no
attention was paid to cleanliness, serious consequences might
follow upon the mere scratch of the lancet or anything else, but
that furnished no real argument against the system.&nbsp; He
quite acknowledged they had no right to prevent Mr. Tomkins
keeping any disease he liked in his own house, but if Tomkins
came out amongst other people, and poisoned them, they had a
right, and it was their duty to the nation, to take measures for
preventing him.</p>
<p>Dr. Thompson was then called upon.&nbsp; He thought in such an
important matter they ought to put aside feeling and look only to
the facts themselves.&nbsp; In the first place, great credit was
due to Dr. Jenner for pressing so forcibly upon public notice the
system of vaccination, although no doubt he did not discover
it.&nbsp; If vaccination did not preserve persons absolutely,
neither did a previous attack of small-pox, for he knew a case of
a woman who had it seven times, and died from the last
attack.&nbsp; A strong point had been made by the other side on
the statement that there had been a great increase in the number
of deaths registered from chest diseases since the introduction
of vaccination.&nbsp; He most unhesitatingly admitted that to be
a fact, but why was it?&nbsp; It was not because of vaccination,
but in consequence of the introduction of the use of that
instrument (producing a stethoscope) for sounding the
chest.&nbsp; Previously there were next to no means of
discovering chest disease, and persons dying from it were
registered as dying from other forms of disease.&nbsp; There had
been no increase shown in the number of deaths from chest <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>disease.&nbsp; More than 20,000 cases had been under his
care during the last seven or eight years, and he had found that
persons suffering from consumption had, in a very large
proportion, suffered from small-pox also.&nbsp; He believed
small-pox to be an exciting cause of consumption, rather than a
preventative as had been asserted.&nbsp; Previous to vaccination,
as many as 4,000 in 1,000,000 died from small-pox, and that
number, since its introduction, had fallen to 158.&nbsp; He
really, in his ignorance, had thought that the anti-vaccination
movement would have ceased in face of the facts from St.
Giles&rsquo;s and Ireland.</p>
<p>The chairman: The sanitary habits of the people have something
to do with the improvement in Ireland.</p>
<p>Dr. Thompson had no doubt that was the case, but it could have
nothing to do with the improvement in St. Giles&rsquo;s, as the
sanitary habits of that place were not very advanced.&nbsp; Let
them continue vaccination till small-pox was eradicated, and then
they could do without it altogether.&nbsp; Small-pox had only
originated once in the history of the world, and if they could
only once stamp it out, it might never recur.&nbsp; His attention
had been called to some figures which he had omitted to notice in
regard to Sweden, where the mortality which was so strikingly
reduced after the introduction of vaccination, that in one year
there were only two deaths, again rose by degrees till it reached
2,000.&nbsp; This was owing to the carelessness of the people,
who thought the disease had gone altogether, and neglected the
continuance of vaccination.&nbsp; Strenuous efforts were again
made when the mortality rose, and it was reduced rapidly, till
there were only 41 deaths in one year.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of Dr. Thompson&rsquo;s speech several
gentlemen rose to put questions to Dr. Thompson, when Dr. Pearce
asked permission of the chairman to reply to the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>two medical
gentlemen who had just addressed them.&nbsp; Permission being
obtained&mdash;</p>
<p>Dr. Pearce said, he felt happy in meeting his two professional
brethren, Dr. Routh and Dr. Thompson, and discussing with them
this important question; and he proposed in order to avoid taxing
the memories of the audience, to mingle the two speeches, and to
reply in the reverse order of their delivery, noticing first the
concluding remarks of Dr. Thompson.</p>
<p>Dr. Thompson had, unhappily for the cause he advocated,
referred to that well vaccinated country, Sweden, where every
child born is vaccinated, and where compulsory vaccination has
been in operation many years.&nbsp; Dr. Thompson had pointed out
that small-pox had declined in that country, in consequence of
vaccination, adducing the fact, that while in 1838 the mortality
was 1,805, in 1839 it was 1,934, it fell in 1840 to 650, and in
1842 to 58; indeed, in 1846 only two deaths from small-pox were
recorded, and this, said Dr. Thompson, was the result of
vaccination; but if he had continued his inquiry to later years,
he would have found, as he will see there in that table, that the
small mortality was owing to the fact that the epidemic had done
its work and taken its departure, but that when another epidemic
came, the mortality was again raised, and in 1849&mdash;31 died;
in 1850&mdash;1,376 died; in 1851 no less than 2,488
died;&mdash;the heaviest mortality for forty years <i>though
every inhabitant of Sweden was vaccinated</i>. <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>And now for Ireland, on which so much stress has been laid of
late.&nbsp; You tell us, that vaccination has extinguished
small-pox in that country.&nbsp; I deny it.&nbsp; For while it is
quite true that small-pox is absent&mdash;this is not the result
of vaccination&mdash;for the Registrar General&rsquo;s returns
shew that there is less vaccination in Ireland than in England,
and far <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>less than in Scotland.&nbsp; You flatter yourselves that
<i>you</i> have put out small-pox by vaccination.&nbsp; In regard
to Ireland the fact is, that inoculation has been clandestinely
carried on in that country, the people having more confidence in
the protecting power of small-pox, a disease which is human, than
in vaccination, a disease of a brute.&nbsp; They have this
instinct, and this instinct is right in the mother who shudders
at the idea of <i>cow</i>-pox.&nbsp; You overrule this instinct
which is natural, with your reason, you impose a substitute which
is revolting.&nbsp; Small-pox is absent from Ireland, but is the
mortality less?&nbsp; No, on the contrary under the operation of
a natural law which I have illustrated in my essay on
vaccination, to which Mr. Snell has alluded, scarlatina has
displaced small-pox, and the general mortality has
increased.&nbsp; It is a general rule that when small-pox is
present you have a low mortality, and when it is absent you have
a higher mortality.&nbsp; Small-pox is absent from England, but
look at your frightful mortality from scarlatina. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; In the last two years, I estimate
the mortality from scarlatina at 40,000 per annum, and small-pox
only 1,500.&nbsp; And what is the nature of this process which
you call <i>vaccination</i>.&nbsp; Dr. McOubrey has already told
you this evening, that the disease which Jenner implanted was
<i>not</i> natural cow-pox, but a disease which developed itself
in phag&aelig;denic ulcerations.&nbsp; You follow Dr. Blane who
advocated vaccination direct from the heifer to avoid the
admitted dangers arising from arm to arm vaccination&mdash;the
diseases transplanted therewith.&nbsp; You tell us to-night, that
vaccination with cow-pox will prevent small-pox.&nbsp; Did Jenner
tell you this?&nbsp; Let me read to you his words at page <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>7 of his
work, published in 1798, he cautions you against trusting to
spontaneous cow-pox, lest you should be deceived into a false
security.</p>
<p>I will read the passage from Jenner, &ldquo;It is necessary to
observe that pustulous sores frequently appear spontaneously on
the nipples of cows, and instances have occurred of the hands of
servants employed in milking, being affected with sores in
consequence, and even of their feeling an indisposition from
absorption.&nbsp; These pustules are of a much milder nature than
those which arise from that contagion which constitutes the
<i>true</i> cow-pox.&nbsp; They are always free from the bluish
or livid tint, so conspicuous in the pustules of that
disease.&nbsp; <i>No erysipelas attends them</i>, <i>nor do they
show any phag&aelig;denic disposition</i>, <i>as in the other
case</i>, but terminate in a scab, without creating any apparent
disorder in the cow.&nbsp; But this disease is not to be
considered as similar in any respect to that of which I am
treating, as it is <i>incapable of producing any specific effects
on the human constitution</i>.&nbsp; However, it is of the
greatest consequence to point it out here, lest the want of
discrimination should occasion an <i>idea</i> of security, from
the infection of small-pox which might prove
delusive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, mark the words&mdash;an idea of
security&mdash;it is an idea, it has no reality; and for this
idea you commit to prison mothers, whose only crime is to refuse
to obey the mandate of a faculty, at whose bidding the Act of
Parliament, which disgraces the statute book was passed.&nbsp;
This spurious vaccination, this vaccination is Dr. Blane&rsquo;s,
it is a sham, a delusion.&nbsp; Have we not proof?&nbsp; Appeals
have been made to-night to the statistics of the Small-pox
Hospital, drawn up by Mr. Marson, its surgeon, in which he very
ingeniously makes it appear, that although 84 of every hundred
cases are found to have been vaccinated, the disease small-pox is
modified by vaccination&mdash;this is a new tangled dodge.&nbsp;
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Mr. Marson
tells us that the mortality in the &ldquo;unprotected&rdquo; is
34 or 35 per cent., that in modified cases it varied from 24 down
to 7 per cent., and that these <i>modified</i> cases were among
the vaccinated.&nbsp; Stress is laid on the importance of the
number of the cicatrices.&nbsp; While Jenner said one puncture
was sufficient, these men tell us that four, five, even six on
each arm are necessary in order to ensure efficient
protection.&nbsp; One dart of the serpent&rsquo;s sting is not
enough.</p>
<p>This ingenious division of the mortality into groups,
according to the number of cicatrices is a delusion.&nbsp; Why,
Mr. Marson tells us, with regard to the &lsquo;modified&rsquo;
cases said to have been vaccinated, but having no marks of
vaccination, that they &ldquo;must have received a protective
influence as regards fatality, which would have been greater, but
for the disease having been influenced by vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it is <i>assumed</i> that when small-pox occurs mildly in
the vaccinated&mdash;that the disease is modified thereby.&nbsp;
The fact being that it depends on the natural susceptibility of
the subject and not on vaccination.&nbsp; This different
susceptibility in the attacked was pointed out by Rhazes, an
Arabian physician, centuries before vaccination was thought of;
but what happens when small-pox occurs in a severe form?&nbsp;
Let us see&mdash;here is Dr. Russell Reynolds&rsquo; System of
Medicine, and in it, vol. 1, 2nd edition, page 229, is an article
by Mr. Marson on small-pox.&nbsp; He tells us that 104 cases of
the severe (corymbose) form of small-pox were admitted into the
hospital&mdash;of these 29 were unvaccinated, 74 were found
vaccinated (mark the greater number were vaccinated as
usual)&mdash;of the 29 unvaccinated, 13 died; of the 74
vaccinated, 32 died;&mdash;shewing a difference in the mortality
of less than 3 per cent.&nbsp; Of the 104 cases one only had been
inoculated, that case died.&nbsp; Here then we see that with all
your boasted protection the great majority <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>are found
with the mark of the beast on the arm, yet they die at the rate
of 42 per cent.</p>
<p>Reference had been made to the diminution of small-pox in the
parish of St. Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At a meeting in Kentish Town
some months ago, Dr. Ross adduced what he thought to be evidence
of the effect of vaccination in St. Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At that
meeting he, Dr. Pearce, had combated Dr. Ross&rsquo;s argument by
shewing that the diminished mortality from small-pox was owing to
its absence and its displacement by scarlatina.</p>
<p>Dr. Seaton&rsquo;s statistics had been quoted to-night in
proof of the advantage of legislation on the subject.&nbsp; That
well paid officer of the Privy Council had drawn up a table for
the Epidemiological Society which he, Dr. Pearce, had republished
in his essay, and which he begged now to hand to Dr. Routh and
Dr. Thomson for their inspection.</p>

<p>Dr. Seaton attributes the diminished mortality from small pox
to compulsory vaccination, closing his account with 1861, which
is the year of lowest mortality in the table.&nbsp; How will he
account for the subsequent increase of mortality from small-pox
under a more vigilant enforcement of the Act of Parliament?</p>
<p>In 1863 it amounted to 5,964; and it rose to 7,684 in 1864;
<i>which was the most fatal year in regard to small-pox for
twenty-four years</i>.&nbsp; If vaccination be really
&ldquo;protective,&rdquo; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and if the gradual diminution of the
mortality from small-pox down to the year 1861 was consequent on
vaccination having been made compulsory, how, and why was the
mortality of 1864 from that disease no less than 6,364 <i>in
excess</i> of the mortality of 1861?</p>
<p>Dr. Routh has quoted Dr. Seaton with a view of illustrating
the contrast between the last century and the present in respect
to the mortality from small-pox.</p>
<p>He has told you that prior to vaccination, the annual
death-rate of small-pox per million of population was
3,000.&nbsp; This was a rough estimate made by Sir Gilbert Blane
and Dr. Lettsom.&nbsp; The value of this &ldquo;estimate&rdquo;
may be judged of, when I tell you that prior to 1838, there were
no complete statistics of mortality.&nbsp; Mr. Simon in his
&ldquo;Papers on Vaccination&rdquo; at page lxviii says,
&ldquo;Till after 1837, <i>there could be no authentic knowledge
of deaths by small-pox</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Farr in the 30th annual report of the Registrar General
says, quoting Dr. Watt, of Glasgow, a child had a better chance
of reaching its tenth year in the last eighteen years of the last
century when small-pox formed 20 per cent. of the whole mortality
than it has now, when small-pox mortality is only two per
cent.</p>
<p>No one disputes that small-pox is less prevalent now than it
was a century ago, but what gain is there?&nbsp; Dr. Farr says,
&ldquo;it is useless to bar the door against one form of zymotic
disease, as small-pox by vaccination, while the <i>causes</i> of
zymotic disease are suffered to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1863 scarlatina destroyed 30,000 in England, a mortality of
1,800 to each million persons living.&nbsp; In 1869 and 1870 the
probability is that the mortality from scarlatina will reach
40,000 annually, shewing a death rate per million of 2,000, while
small-pox will probably not exceed 70 to a million.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Small-pox was a scourge in Europe a century ago.&nbsp;
Now, scarlatina is the scourge, and this will continue.&nbsp; One
or other form of zymotic disease will continue to exist while the
causes which develope them remain.&nbsp; You gentlemen, who
advocate vaccination as a preventive measure are in
error&mdash;you begin at the wrong end&mdash;you aim not at
taking away the cause, but prefer to contaminate the body with
one disease, to prevent the subject from taking another, which is
the result of filthy habitations, unclean towns, and bad sanitary
arrangements.</p>
<p>It has been disputed to-night that diseases are induced by
vaccination; will it be denied that erysipelas is a
common&mdash;a frequent result of the process?&nbsp; What are the
facts?&nbsp; Erysipelas, which, prior to vaccination, was a
disease incident to adult life, especially to middle age, is now
a disease of infant life.&nbsp; In the Registrar General&rsquo;s
returns, you will find in the six years 1862 to 1867, there died
of this disease 10,635, including all ages from birth to 80
years; of that number no less than 3,261 died in the first year
of life, <i>the year of vaccination</i>, while 3,904 died under
five years of age.&nbsp; This frightful mortality of infants is
the direct consequence of vaccination; a natural result; indeed,
Jenner tells us that, that vaccination is alone protective, which
is attended by erysipelas; while the spontaneous cow-pox, which
is <i>unattended</i> by erysipelas, is not protective.&nbsp; Yet
when children die of erysipelas following vaccination, the deaths
are certified &ldquo;<i>death from erysipelas</i>,&rdquo; while
the truth is concealed.&nbsp; The death should be certified
properly, <span class="GutSmall">DEATH FROM
VACCINATION</span>.&nbsp; But when an inquest is held in this
parish, under the coronership of Dr. Lankester, on a child of Mr.
Emery of Great Portland-street, although the evidence adduced to
the jury clearly shewed that the child died in consequence of
vaccination, efforts are made to conceal the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>fact; for
while the jury unanimously returned a verdict &ldquo;<i>died from
erysipelas caused by vaccination</i>,&rdquo; the coroner&rsquo;s
copy deposited at the Registrar General&rsquo;s office,
Somerset-house, certifies the additional words &ldquo;<i>death by
misadventure</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; And with what
object were those words added, but to screen the operator, by
whose vaccinating hand another child also lost its life (probably
with the same lancet) on which the coroner for Westminster, Mr.
Bedford, held an inquest.&nbsp; I do not say that Dr. Lankester
intentionally suppressed the truth, to save his professional
brother, but I do say, that it is highly dangerous to the
community, to have a <i>medical</i> coroner, whose leanings in
favor of his profession may lead him into partial verdicts.&nbsp;
The duty of a coroner is to hear evidence, and direct the jury as
to the <i>law</i>, not to give opinions with a professional
bias.&nbsp; Compulsory vaccination may be defined to be
manslaughter by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>So much for one disease, Erysipelas.&nbsp; Let us now come to
another frightfully increasing disease of infant life,
Diarrh&oelig;a.&nbsp; I have, during the last twenty years in
which I have given my attention to this subject&mdash;vaccination
and its effects&mdash;observed the frequency with which
vaccination of infants is followed by a fatal kind of
diarrh&oelig;a.&nbsp; Enteritis of infants has without doubt
increased and is increasing.</p>
<p>I was not surprised, therefore, to find in the twelfth report
of the medical office of the Privy Council, just published, a
paper by Dr. Seaton on vaccination in Paris, in which at page
176, occurs the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>In some cases the vaccinated calves have
suffered from diarrh&oelig;a</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>At page
178, &ldquo;In Depaul&rsquo;s seventh and eighth experiments, for
example, <i>the calves suffered severely from
diarrh&oelig;a</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another passage, page 178, shows that diarrh&oelig;a is an
accompaniment of the process; &ldquo;the health of the calf,
however, affects the character of the eruption, for it has been
observed that <i>when diarrh&oelig;a happens in the course of its
evolution</i>, the pustules, although they rise as in the healthy
calf, are smaller in size, and less full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus infant mortality is increased by the infliction of a
disease of the brute creation, which in the &ldquo;course of its
evolution,&rdquo; causes diarrh&oelig;a.</p>
<p>The medical press has lately teemed with articles calling
attention to the prevalence of small-pox, in Paris, it is stated
that small-pox prevails there because vaccination is not
compulsory.&nbsp; While it is quite true that the Legislature of
Prance has passed no such disgraceful and tyrannical vaccination
acts, as those which exist in England,&mdash;yet vaccination is
almost universally adopted.&nbsp; Mr. Smee, the surgeon to the
Bank of England, and examiner of candidates for life assurance,
lately, in a letter to the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; newspaper, stated
that his large experience enabled him to state that to find a
Frenchman unvaccinated was an exception.&nbsp; The 12th report of
the medical officer of the Privy Council tells us that in France
it has been decreed, under the direction of the Academy of
Medicine, by ministers, that &ldquo;No infant should enter an
orphan asylum, an hospital, a primary school, a lyceum, or a
government college without a certificate, of
vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Army and Navy of France are vaccinated, and vaccination is
enjoined, if not enforced, on all who hold government
situations.&nbsp; Besides this, it is forced upon the poor by a
rule that &ldquo;<i>those who refuse to have their children
vaccinated</i>, <i>shall have no public
assistance</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The
fact is, that vaccination has failed in Paris, as in every other
city.&nbsp; Let the medical gentlemen opposite, look to the paper
of Dr. Seaton, whose cooked statistics they have quoted to-night;
the paper to which I have before alluded, presented to the Lords
of the Privy Council in the 12th report of Mr. Simon, and at page
188, they will find the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Striking exemplification of the danger of
confiding in animal vaccination during an outbreak of small-pox
has been given during the present epidemic in Paris, no doubt a
large share of the <i>unsuccess</i> which has <i>notoriously</i>
attended the practice, has been due to the hurry, and other
unfavorable conditions under which it has been carried on.&nbsp;
<i>But apart from this</i>, <i>and where the conditions have been
favorable</i>, <span class="GutSmall">THE FAILURES HAVE BEEN
QUITE REMARKABLE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I unhesitatingly affirm that vaccination from whatever source,
whether from the heifer direct or from arm to arm, or even the
heel of the greasy horse, which Jenner defined to be the <i>true
source of protective matter</i>, is not only a failure&mdash;it
is a delusion, an imposture, and the law which enforces it at the
bidding of the medical department of the Privy Council, is a
disgrace to the Statute Book of England, and ought to be
repealed.&nbsp; For the reasons I have given, after nearly twenty
years of attention to this important subject, I support the
resolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Glidden made a few observations in support of the medical
men who had spoken in advocacy of vaccination, expressing his
surprise at the want of modesty in the last speaker, who, as a
member of a learned profession, spoke disparagingly of his
medical brethren, and applied the term &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; to
statistics on the other side, while he produced a multitude of
statistics of his own.</p>
<p>The chairman here interposed stating that Dr. Pearce <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>head only
produced the official statistics of the Registrar General.&nbsp;
The resolution was then put and carried with only four
dissentients.</p>
<p>Mr. R. B. Gibbs, Hon. Sec. to the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination
League, moved &ldquo;that a memorial be presented to the Lords of
Her Majesty&rsquo;s Privy Council, praying them to suspend the
vaccination laws until the inquiry, promised by the Government,
had been made,&rdquo; and said, that similar requests had been
made several times, and that so far back as 1856, the government
had promised a committee of the House of Commons, which promise
was evaded.&nbsp; Instead of a committee an <i>exparte</i>
investigation was made by sending a string of questions to a
number of interested doctors, who, of course upheld the
system.&nbsp; This course was much the same as if the late Royal
Commission on Trades Unions had written to the secretaries of the
various unions, to enquire how they worked.&nbsp; If a question
had been asked of Broadhead, respecting the Saw-Grinders&rsquo;
Union, of course, he would have reported that it was working
satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Mr. Gibbs said, that the League would be satisfied with
nothing less than a full investigation of the Medical Trades
Unions.&nbsp; He then adverted to the case of the Rev. H. J.
Allen, who had appealed to the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench
against a second conviction, which conviction had been upheld by
the Court, and Mr. Allen left to pay a lawyer&rsquo;s bill of
over &pound;30.&nbsp; He trusted that the lovers of freedom would
assist him in his difficulties.&nbsp; Mr. Gibbs then referred to
the important testimony, lately adduced by medical gentlemen in
Manchester and elsewhere, that the evil results of vaccination
were often apparent after &ldquo;successful&rdquo; operations
with &ldquo;pure lymph,&rdquo; and reminded the audience that it
was from the effects of such an <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>operation, that Sir Culling Eardley,
and many others had died.&nbsp; In view of such uncertainties,
Mr. Gibbs argued that it was cruel to enforce the prisoning of
the community.</p>
<p>The resolution was seconded by Mr. MacHeath, who in an
interesting and amusing speech alluded to the
&ldquo;beastly&rdquo; practice of vaccinating the human
species.</p>
<p>The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Dr. Caplin moved a vote of thanks to the Chairman, which was
heartily responded to, and the meeting, which was most effective,
was brought to a close.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
